Hello! I'm Michalina, a burgeoning Software Tester making my entry into the realm of quality assurance with a solid foundation in both manual and automation testing. My interest in software testing sparked from a desire to ensure that technology not only meets its design specifications but also exceeds user expectations in reliability and performance. 

My journey into this fascinating world began at Coders Lab, where I completed an intensive course of 80 hours in manual testing and 48 hours in automation testing training. This experience has armed me with the foundational skills and knowledge necessary to embark on a career dedicated to enhancing software quality. I am currently preparing for the ISTQB certification, aiming to solidify my credentials and deepen my understanding of software testing principles and practices.

On this GitHub, you will find projects and exercises derived from my Coders Lab coursework, showcasing my developing expertise in creating detailed test plans, executing test cases, and employing automation tools to streamline the testing process. I am keen on furthering my proficiency in web automation with Selenium, API testing, and developing my Java skills. I'm actively seeking opportunities to apply what I've learned in real-world scenarios.

üí° Currently learning: Preparing for the ISTQB Foundation Level exam to deepen my understanding of software testing standards and methodologies.
